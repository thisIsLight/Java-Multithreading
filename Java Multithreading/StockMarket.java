/*
 * Description: Create a stock market simulation where multiple traders (threads) buy and sell stocks concurrently. Each trader has its own strategy and behavior.
Skills Practiced:
Thread communication and synchronization
Shared data structures (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap)
Real-time data processing
Features:
Each trader thread performs buy/sell operations based on random or preset strategies.
Use a thread-safe data structure to manage stock prices and trading volumes.
Allow traders to update stock prices in real-time, and synchronize access to shared stock data.
Optional Enhancements:
Implement different market conditions (bull/bear market).
Add visualization to track stock price fluctuations in real-time.
Implement external data input to simulate real market prices.
