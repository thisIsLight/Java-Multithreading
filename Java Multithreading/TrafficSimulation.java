/*
Description: 
    Simulate a traffic system where cars (threads) move through intersections, respecting traffic lights. Use threads to represent cars and traffic lights.

Skills Practiced:
    Synchronization for controlling car movement and traffic lights
    Simulating real-world systems with multithreading

Features:
    Cars represented as threads move between intersections.
    Traffic lights at intersections control car movement.
    Use locks or semaphores to control access to intersections.
    Optional Enhancements:
    Simulate different types of intersections (4-way, roundabouts).
    Add visualization for the traffic flow and car movement.
    Introduce different vehicle behaviors (e.g., random movement, following traffic rules).
