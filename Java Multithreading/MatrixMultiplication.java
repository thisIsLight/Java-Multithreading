/* 
Description: Implement matrix multiplication using multiple threads. Each thread will be responsible for computing a portion of the resulting matrix.
Skills Practiced:
Parallel computing
Synchronization of shared resources
Optimizing performance using thread pools
Features:
Input: Two large matrices.
Use multiple threads to compute parts of the resulting matrix in parallel.
Use ExecutorService to manage the thread pool.
Optional Enhancements:
Use a parallel algorithm for larger matrices.
Analyze and improve performance by tuning thread pool size and task distribution.
