/*
 * Description: Create a simulation of a producer-consumer scenario where producers create tasks or items, and consumers process them. Implement this using a blocking queue.
Skills Practiced:
Synchronization (BlockingQueue, Condition)
Producer-consumer pattern
Features:
Producers generate items at random intervals.
Consumers process items concurrently.
Use LinkedBlockingQueue to store tasks.
Ensure thread safety and proper synchronization.
Optional Enhancements:
Implement multiple producers and consumers with different processing speeds.
Allow dynamic addition and removal of producers/consumers.
Use ReentrantLock and condition variables to demonstrate manual locking instead of BlockingQueue.
