/*
Description: Simulate a banking system where multiple threads represent bank customers performing transactions (withdrawals, deposits, transfers) on shared bank accounts.
Skills Practiced:
Thread synchronization (synchronized, ReentrantLock)
Shared resource management (bank accounts)
Features:
Multiple threads performing different banking operations concurrently.
Ensure that account balances are updated correctly using locks.
Use ReentrantLock to implement fine-grained locking for individual accounts.
Optional Enhancements:
Implement different types of bank accounts (e.g., savings, checking).
Introduce a transaction logging mechanism to record every transaction.
Simulate account interest and overdraft conditions.
