/*
 * Description: Develop a simple game engine that can manage multiple tasks concurrently, such as rendering graphics, handling player input, and performing background calculations (e.g., AI or physics simulation).
Skills Practiced:
Thread scheduling
Synchronization between threads (e.g., for rendering and input handling)
Timers and ScheduledExecutorService
Features:
Separate threads for game logic (physics, AI) and rendering.
Use ScheduledExecutorService to manage regular updates like game physics or animations.
Optional Enhancements:
Add support for multiplayer gameplay using threads for each player.
Implement save and load functionality for game states.
